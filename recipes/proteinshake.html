    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Protein shakes (or protein smoothies) are a protein drink typically consumed before or after a workout in order to aid in muscle recovery.<br>
            Protein shakes are usually made with frozen fruit/ice, a protein source such as protein powder, and a liquid.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup frozen fruit or ice</li>
        <li>2-4 servings protein powder</li>
        <li>1/3 - 1 cup of milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>First, place fruit or ice on the bottom of your high-speed blender.</li>
        <li>Next, add in a few of your favorite protein sources. We recommend using anywhere from 2-4 different sources here depending on how much protein you’d like to consume.</li>
        <li>Add in 1/3 cup of liquid to start and an optional sweetener, if desired.</li>
        <li>Then, put the lid on your blender and blend on high for about a minute or until smooth.<br>
            If your protein shake isn’t blending easily, add a little bit more liquid and continue blending.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
